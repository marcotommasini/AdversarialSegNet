# Analysis of loss function impact on Real-time Domain Adaptation in Semantic Segmentation

This report aims at clarifying what is the impact
of the loss function in the accuracy of a Real-time Domain
Adaptation in Semantic Segmentation model, using adversarial
networks, and with class imbalance. By comparing three different
loss types and comparing the results, it became clear that using
different functions to calculate the loss while training produces
severely different analysis.
